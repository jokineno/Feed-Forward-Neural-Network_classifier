# 6 different Neural Networks projects

## Twitter Sentiment Classification 
- Logistic Regression used as a model
- In this project I'm using Pytorch library for classifying tweets. 
- Also, Google's pretrained word embeddings are used for building CBOW representations of the tweets. 

## Twitter Sentiment Classification
- Feed-Forward Neural Network
- Pretrained word embeddings
- Similar to project1 but instead of using pretrained word embeddings I'm implementing BOW representations of each tweet. 

## project3
## project4
## project5
## project6

## Final project: Image captioning
- Implemenent encoder-decoder network to create caption from image inputs. 
- The implementation is based on the article Show and Tell by Google Engineers. 
- The code references are attached to .py files. 

### Encoder: CNN
- Pretrained Resnet34 on ImageNet downloaded from Pytorch models page. 

### Decoder: LSTM 
- Trained on Puhti cloud computing environment. 

NOTE: The code skeletons are provided by course stuff at Introduction to Deep Learning at University of Helsinki but final implementations are my own work.
