# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network_classifier

## project1 
- In this project I'm using Pytorch library for classifying tweets. 
- Also, Google's pretrained word embeddings are used for building CBOW representations of the tweets. 

## project2 
- Similar to project1 but instead of using pretrained word embeddings I'm implementing BOW representations of each tweet. 


NOTE: Code skeletons were provided by course stuff at Introduction to Deep Learning at University of Helsinki.
