# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network_classifier

- In this project I'm using Pytorch library for classifying tweets. 
- Also, Google's pretrained word embeddings are used for building CBOW representations of the tweets. 

NOTE: Part of the code is provided by course stuff at Introduction to Deep Learning at University of Helsinki.
